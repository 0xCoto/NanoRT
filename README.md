## About VIRGO
VIRGO is an easy-to-use spectrometer and radiometer based on [Python](https://www.python.org) and [GNU Radio Companion](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/GNURadioCompanion) (GRC) that is conveniently applicable to any radio telescope working with a GRC-supported software-defined radio (SDR). A list of GRC-supported SDRs can be found [here](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Hardware).
